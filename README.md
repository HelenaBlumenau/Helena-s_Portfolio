# [Project 1: Exploring Determinants and Constructing a Predictive Model for Global Life Expectancy](https://github.com/HelenaBlumenau/Helena-s_Portfolio/blob/main/Global%20Life%20Expectancy%20Predictive%20Model.pdf)

This is a project I did for my Master's program Linear Regression Course.

This study examines factors correlated with global life expectancy through the construction of a comprehensive predictor model. Utilizing multiple linear regression, an array of predictor variables were explored, resulting in a final model that reflects crucial aspects of health and socio-economic status. Adult mortality, alcohol consumpion, measles cases, body mass index, polio vaccination rates, diphtheria vaccination rates, the country's developmental status, and gross domestic product were included in the final model. 

* Data set originates from the World Health Organization's Global Health Observatory (GHO) Data Repository, and was cleaned to account for missing values
* Data analysis and visualization conducted in R
* Statistical methods used include Automatic Model Selection Methods; Bayesian Information Criterion, Mallow's Cp, R-squared, and residual sum of squares, and Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation to assess predictive performance
* Model assumptions were checked through residual analysis


# [Project 2: A Statistical Examination of Factors Impacting Market Share in the Packaged Foods Industry](https://github.com/HelenaBlumenau/Helena-s_Portfolio/blob/main/Statistical%20Examination%20of%20Factors%20Impacting%20Market%20Share.pdf)

This is a project I did for my Master's program Introduction to Statistical Programming in R Course.

This study determined the factors that influence market share for an individual product offered by a large packaged goods manufacturer. Through regression modeling, the research focuses on understanding the influence of price, advertising exposure, discounts, promotions, month and year on market share. Pricing strategies, discounts, promotions and time of year were included in the final model.

* Data set originates from Nielsen, a comprehensive national data base
* Data analysis and visualization conducted in R
* Statistical methods used include Automatic Model Selection Methods; Akaike Information Criterion, Mallow's Cp, R-squared, and residual sum of squares
* Time based analysis was conducted to examine how market share can be maximized with minimal cost
* Model assumptions were checked through residual analysis
